// claude-tmux — the claude implementation of the harness port, over tmux.
//
// HarnessRef: { harness: 'claude', session: 'bc-<id>', window?, cwd, resumeId? }
//   session  — tmux session name (predictable `bc-*`, the captain's attach escape hatch)
//   window   — when present, the agent lives in a named WINDOW of that session
//              instead of owning the whole session (papercut #8: workers as
//              windows inside their lieutenant's session). Window names must
//              start with a letter — a numeric name would be parsed by tmux as
//              a window INDEX — and every tmux call addresses the pane with the
//              exact-match `=session:=window` form. Lifecycle coupling is
//              accepted design: the session dying takes its windows with it.
//   resumeId — the claude session uuid. Set deterministically at spawn via
//              `--session-id <uuid>` (verified claude 2.1.202), refreshed from
//              Stop-hook payloads. `claude --resume <resumeId>` keeps the SAME
//              id (no fork by default), so the ref survives any number of
//              death/resume cycles.
//
// Session/window/pane plumbing is shared with the other tmux adapters —
// see tmux-session.js. This module owns only what is claude-specific:
// launch line, screen signatures, the Stop-hook install, and resume.
//
// Verified launch template (mined from firstmate's fm-spawn.sh):
//   CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false claude --dangerously-skip-permissions \
//     --session-id <uuid>
//   - CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false kills the dim "ghost text"
//     prompt suggestion that otherwise reads as pending composer input.
//   - the prompt is NEVER passed on the command line — claude launches bare,
//     and once launch-settle confirms the composer is up, the prompt is typed
//     into it via the same verified-submit machinery send() uses (t.submit).
//     A prompt riding in argv would sit in that process's command line for
//     the life of the session — visible to `ps`/`pgrep -f`, and a broad
//     pattern-kill run BY that very agent (matching its own argv) could
//     freeze or kill itself. The prompt file in stateDir stays the source of
//     truth; only the delivery mechanism changed.
//   - a fresh cwd triggers claude's folder-trust dialog even with
//     --dangerously-skip-permissions (verified); spawn auto-accepts it.
//
// Turn boundaries: spawn installs a Stop hook in <cwd>/.claude/settings.local.json
// running harness/turnend-hook.js, which appends to <stateDir>/<session>.turnend.jsonl
// (and optionally POSTs to a callback URL). onTurnEnd() tails that file.
